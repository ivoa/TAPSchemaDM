TAPSchemaDM
===========

This is the TAP schema defined using VO-DML and created with the VO-DML tools.

The database serialization of this model matches the description of the [TAP schema in the TAP Standard](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/20190927/REC-TAP-1.1.html#tth_sEc4). However the XML serialization uses some slightly different terminology.

The [vodml tooling](https://github.com/ivoa/vo-dml) will produce TAP schema instances (serialized as XML) automatically for each model.
